    # v2 adding as features, available as cli paramaters only atm (v1)
    # allowed values are parsed case-insensitive: [true|yes|YES|..] or [false|no|NO|..]
    # not as strings in quotes "yes" or 'yes'

    # default and recommended is: false
      #   in CDF 2022 support for this special-groups is not necessary anymore

    # new in v2 to configure prior (v1) hard-coded naming elements
    # Most of the naming-configurations don't have a functional effect, but affect
    # naming of Groups, Datasets and RAWDBs only.
    # All given feature values are reflecting the default values,
    # to support a smooth v1 migration.
    #
    # Recommended values for a new v2-project are given as comments!
